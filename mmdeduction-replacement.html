&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <B>deduction</B> (also called an <B>inference</B>) is a kind of
statement that needs some hypotheses to be true in order for its
conclusion to be true.  A <B>theorem</B>, on the other hand, has no
hypotheses (or all its hypotheses are definition).
(Informally we may call both of them theorems, but on this
page we will stick to the strict definition.)

<P>
When being rigorous,
it is surprisingly complicated to convert some deduction in the form
<IMG SRC='_vdash.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='|-'
ALIGN=TOP> <IMG SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'
ALIGN=TOP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC='bigto.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19
ALT='=&gt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG SRC='_vdash.gif' WIDTH=10
HEIGHT=19 ALT='|-'> <IMG SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19
ALT='ta'>
into some theorem in the form
<IMG SRC='_vdash.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='|-'
ALIGN=TOP> <IMG SRC='lp.gif' WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=19 ALT='('><IMG
SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'> <IMG
SRC='to.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19 ALT='-&gt;'> <IMG
SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='ta'><IMG SRC='rp.gif'
WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=19 ALT=')'>.
The deduction says,
"if we can prove
<IMG SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'>
 then we can prove
<IMG SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='ta'>,&quot;
which is in some
sense weaker than saying
&quot;<IMG SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'>
implies
<IMG SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='ta'>.&quot;
In particular, there is no axiom of logic that
permits us to directly obtain the theorem given the deduction.
The conversion of a deduction to a theorem does not even hold in general
for <A HREF="../qlegif/mmql.html#prop">quantum propositional calculus</A>,
which is a weak subset of classical propositional calculus.
It has been shown that adding the Standard Deduction Theorem
(below) to quantum propositional calculus turns it into classical
propositional calculus!

<P>
This is in contrast to going the other way;
if we have the theorem, it is easy to recover the
deduction using modus ponens <A HREF="ax-mp.html">ax-mp</A>.
An example of this is the derivation of the inference
<A HREF="simpli.html">simpli</A> from the theorem <A
HREF="simpl.html">simpl</A>.

<P>
In traditional logic books, this is often resolved using a metatheorem
called the <B>Deduction Theorem</B> (discovered independently
by Herbrand and Tarski around 1930).
The deduction theorem, aka the standard deduction theorem,
provides an algorithm for constructing a proof of
a theorem from the proof of its corresponding deduction.
See, for example, Margaris, <I>First Order Mathematical Logic,</I> p. 56.
To construct a proof for a theorem, the deduction theorem's algorithm
looks at each step in the proof of the original deduction and rewrites
the step with several steps wherein the hypothesis is eliminated and
becomes an antecedent.
Ordinary mathematical proofs invoke this algorithm when converting
a deduction into a theorem.

<P>
However, in practice, no one actually carries out this conversion
algorithm in ordinary mathematics.
Instead, mathematicians often stop once they believe the conversion
could be done.
This sharply contrasts with Metamath's philosophical goal, which is
to show all proofs <I>directly</I> from
the axiom system in its database, and not skip steps or
rely on higher-level metatheorems derived outside of that axiom system.

<P>Metamath is capable of converting a hypothesis into an antecedent.
We have found that in many cases where this is desired
it easier to do this using a weakened form of the deduction theorem,
called the <B>weak deduction theorem</B>
(<A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> and its variants).
For more information using the deduction theorem and the
weak deduction theorem, see the
<A HREF="mmdeduction-theorem.html">deduction theorem page</A>.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="current"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Current approach</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<P>
Using the deduction theorem, or a weak
variant of it, is rarely used today in MPE when creating new proofs.

<P>Current MPE conventions instead encourage using forms
that are easier to deal with directly.
In particular, there is a preference for
instead writing assertions in "deduction form"
(applying this approach is called "deduction style").
In an assertion in deduction form, the conclusion is prefixed with
<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>
<IMG SRC='to.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' -&gt;' TITLE='-&gt;'>,
and every hypothesis is a definition or is also prefixed with
<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>
<IMG SRC='to.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' -&gt;' TITLE='-&gt;'>.
In this form the antecedent
<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>
mimics the context in a deduction proof system.
For more information, see
<A HREF="http://us.metamath.org/ocat/natded.pdf">"Natural Deductions in the
Metamath Proof Language" by Mario Carneiro, 2014</A>.

<P>
Many other theorems are presented as "tautologies" or "tautology form"
(a form with no hypotheses or where all hypotheses are definitions).
Tautologies are not deductions and thus require no special treatment.
These forms
are much easier to deal with directly in Metamath as compared to deductions,
produce clearer proofs.
simplifies proof reuse,
and leads to fewer situations where the deduction theorem
(and its variants) are needed.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="natural-deduction"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Natural Deduction</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It is possible to develop proofs in MPE that follow the style
Gentzen's natural deduction rules.
In short, use deduction form, and apply MPE theorems that are their
logical equivalent.
