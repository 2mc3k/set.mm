# Wolf Lammen posted the following to the Metamath mailing list of
# Tue, 1 Oct 2019 23:04:56 -0700 (PDT)
# From: "'ookami' via Metamath"
# "You may use the Chinese/Japanese character displayed here
# https://www.japanesewordswriting.com/image-of-japanese-kanji-for-wolf-and-related-words-700/
# I don't know whether taking a screenshot creates copyright issues. As an
# alternative, take the character from one of various Unicode fonts. Here is
# its representation in text: 狼
# For those curious: My first name matches that of the animal wolve in
# German, and the character is its representation in Japanese kanji (and
# Chinese as well, I believe).."
#
# David A. Wheeler: I'm not a lawyer. It may be true that we could use
# http://www.japanesewordswriting.com/images/ookami.png
# but out of an abundance of caution I will instead recreate a simple
# image with the word (it's easy to do).

# Alexander van der Vekens sent an email to David A. Wheeler saying,
# "here is a picture of me (from my linkedin profile) you can use for the
# Gource visualization."
#
# Gérard Lang graciously emailed to David A. Wheeler
# on 2020-04-11 a .psd file of his face.
# Unfortunately Gource can't handle .psd files, so David hand-converted it.
#
# Thierry Arnoux (Tirix) emailed to David A. Wheeler on 2020-04-11
# his GitHub avatar.

# On 2020-04-12 Stanislas Polu emailed avatars for himself and OpenAI
# to David A. Wheeler. For OpenAI he sent a .tif file, but many tools
# can't handle that format, so "convert" was used to create a .png file.
