This is Metamath Solitaire, an evolved version
of Norm Megill's Metamath Solitaire applet. To
compile, you will need a copy of Ant <http://ant.apache.org/>
and Sun's JDK version 1.5 <http://java.sun.com/>.
After downloading and installing typing 'ant' 
will result in the creation of a jar file called
'gui.jar'. Executing 'java -jar gui.jar' will 
launch the program. Should you wish to hack a bit,
data files are in data/, and the source is in
mm/. There is also a text-based version available.
To compile it, install GNU Getopt for Java
<http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html>
and modify build.xml appropriatly. After that,
'ant text' will result in text.jar. Adding that to
your classpath will enable you to run 'java mm.mmtxt'
with the proof you wish to see entered as command
line arguments. Further information can be found
by perusing the source. Enjoy!
